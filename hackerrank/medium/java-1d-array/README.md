# Java 1D Array (Part 2)

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Let's play a game on an array! You're standing at index $0$ of an $n$-element array named $game$. From some index $i$ (where $0 \le i \lt n$), you can perform one of the following moves:

* *Move Backward:* If cell $i - 1$ exists *and* contains a $0$, you can walk back to cell $i - 1$.
* *Move Forward:* 
	- If cell $i + 1$ contains a zero, you can walk to cell $i + 1$.
    - If cell $i + leap$ contains a zero, you can jump to cell $i + leap$.
    - If you're standing in cell $n - 1$ or the value of $i + leap \ge n$, you can walk or jump off the end of the array and win the game.

In other words, you can move from index $i$ to index $i+1$, $i-1$, or $i + leap$ as long as the destination index is a cell containing a $0$. If the destination index is greater than $n-1$, you win the game.

**Function Description**   

Complete the *canWin* function in the editor below.   

*canWin* has the following parameters:   

- *int leap:* the size of the leap   
- *int game[n]:* the array to traverse   

**Returns**   

- *boolean:* true if the game can be won, otherwise false   

**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer, $q$, denoting the number of queries (i.e., function calls). 	
The $2 \cdot q$ subsequent lines describe each query over two lines:

1. The first line contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of $n$ and $leap$.
2. The second line contains $n$ space-separated binary integers (i.e., zeroes and ones) describing the respective values of $game_0, game_1, \ldots, game_{n-1}$.

**Constraints**

* $1 \le q \le 5000$
* $2 \le n \le 100$
* $0 \le leap \le 100$
* It is guaranteed that the value of $game[0]$ is always $0$.

**Output Format**

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    public static boolean canWin(int leap, int[] game) {
        // Return true if you can win the game; otherwise, return false.
          return isSolvable(leap, game, 0);
    }

    private static boolean isSolvable(int leap, int[] game, int i) {
        // Base Cases
        // 1. If the index is greater than or equal to the array length, you won the game.
        if (i >= game.length) {
            return true;
        }
        // 2. If the index is negative or pointing to a blocked cell (value 1), you cannot proceed.
        if (i < 0 || game[i] == 1) {
            return false;
        }

        // Mark the current cell as visited by setting it to 1 to avoid infinite recursion loops
        game[i] = 1;

        // Recursively check all three allowed moves:
        // Move forward by 'leap', move forward by 1, or move backward by 1
        return isSolvable(leap, game, i + leap) || 
               isSolvable(leap, game, i + 1) || 
               isSolvable(leap, game, i - 1);
    }    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int q = scan.nextInt();
        while (q-- > 0) {
            int n = scan.nextInt();
            int leap = scan.nextInt();
            
            int[] game = new int[n];
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                game[i] = scan.nextInt();
            }

            System.out.println( (canWin(leap, game)) ? "YES" : "NO" );
        }
        scan.close();
    }
}

```
